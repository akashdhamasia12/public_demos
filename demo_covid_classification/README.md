# Covid classification demo with uncertainty estimation & IPEX (CPU)
This repo showcases covid classification demo which is trained on multiple architectures such as VGG, Resnet50, Dense121, Efficient-net and custom models. In this demo, we will integrate Intel extension for PyTorch(IPEX) and uncertainty estimation techniques in both training and inference phase.
